# Brent Oil Price Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing how significant political and economic events influence Brent oil prices. By employing statistical modeling and change point analysis, we aim to provide actionable insights for investors, analysts, and policymakers.

## Business Objective
The primary goal is to study the impact of key events (political decisions, conflicts, sanctions, and OPEC policies) on Brent oil prices, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.

## Situational Overview
As a data scientist at Birhan Energies, a consultancy firm specializing in data-driven insights for the energy sector, the analysis aims to:
- Identify key events affecting Brent oil prices over the past decade.
- Measure the impact of these events on price changes.
- Provide clear, data-driven insights to guide investment strategies and policy development.

## Data
The dataset includes historical Brent oil prices from May 20, 1987, to September 30, 2022, with the following fields:
- **Date**: The date of the recorded price (formatted as ‘day-month-year’).
- **Price**: The price of Brent oil in USD per barrel.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Skills**: 
  - Statistical Modelling using PyMC3
  - Understanding Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo Markov Chain
- **Knowledge**: 
  - Probability distributions and their relevance
  - Time series analysis techniques

## Project Tasks
### Task 1: Data Analysis Workflow
- Define the data analysis workflow.
- Understand model inputs, parameters, and outputs.
- Identify assumptions and limitations.

### Task 2: Analyze Brent Oil Prices
- Apply time series analysis techniques (e.g., ARIMA, GARCH).
- Explore advanced models (e.g., VAR, LSTM) to capture market conditions.
- Investigate economic indicators and technological changes affecting oil prices.

### Task 3: Develop an Interactive Dashboard
- Build a dashboard using Flask (backend) and React (frontend).
- Visualize analysis results, allowing users to explore how events impact oil prices.

## Key Features of the Dashboard
- Interactive visualizations of historical trends and correlations with events.
- Filters and date range selectors for detailed exploration.
- Display of key indicators like volatility and model accuracy metrics.
